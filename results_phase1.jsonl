Diffusion models are a class of generative models that have gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the field of computer vision and image processing. In simple terms, a diffusion model is a type of neural network that is designed to learn a probability distribution over a set of data, such as images or audio signals.\n\nThe core idea behind diffusion models is to iteratively refine a noisy input signal until it converges to the original clean signal. This is done by applying a series of transformations to the input signal, each of which is designed to progressively refine the signal and move it closer to the target distribution.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of", "temperature": 0.7, "max_new_tokens": 128, "execution_time": 187.2904}
